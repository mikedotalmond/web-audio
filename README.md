### Playing with [Haxe](http://haxe.org/), [Flambe](https://github.com/aduros/flambe), and the [Web-Audio](http://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio/) APIs

There are a few presets, but no UI for selecting them at the moment... use the up/down arrow-keys to cycle through them.

Currently only works in Chrome. You might get some odd sounds in Firefox, or nothing at all.
